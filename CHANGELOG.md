- AMD64 builds: Linux AMD64 containers with Rosetta emulation
- Eliminated cross-compilation issues with C dependencies

#### Build System
- Building inside official Rust containers (`rust:latest`)
- Full Linux environment for both ARM64 and AMD64 targets
- Proper support for C dependencies (openssl, protobuf, etc.)
- Binary verification and checksums for all builds

### Brain Server
- Optimized builds for ARM64 (Jetson Nano) and AMD64
- Debian packages included for easy installation
- All tests passing

### Signal Gateway

- Zero clippy warnings
- Optimized builds for ARM64 (Jetson Nano) and AMD64
- Debian packages included for easy installation
- All tests passing

### Artifacts
- **brain-server_arm64.deb** - Debian package for Jetson Nano
