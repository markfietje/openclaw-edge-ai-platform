- Eliminated cross-compilation issues with C dependencies

#### Build System
- Building inside official Rust containers (`rust:latest`)
- Full Linux environment for both ARM64 and AMD64 targets
- Proper support for C dependencies (openssl, protobuf, etc.)
- Binary verification and checksums for all builds

### Brain Server
- Optimized builds for ARM64 (Jetson Nano) and AMD64
- Debian packages included for easy installation
- All tests passing

### Signal Gateway
- **Fixed code formatting issues** in signal-gateway/src/api/mod.rs
- Applied cargo fmt for consistent code style
- Zero clippy warnings
- Optimized builds for ARM64 (Jetson Nano) and AMD64
- Debian packages included for easy installation
- All tests passing

### Artifacts
- **brain-server_arm64.deb** - Debian package for Jetson Nano
- **brain-server_amd64.deb** - Debian package for standard Linux
- **signal-gateway_arm64.deb** - Debian package for Jetson Nano
- **signal-gateway_amd64.deb** - Debian package for standard Linux
- Binary tarballs with SHA256 checksums

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-24

### Signal Gateway

#### Security
- Updated `reqwest` to 0.13.1 (security fix)
- Added input validation for recipients (UUID, phone E.164, ACI formats)
- Added input validation for messages (length, content)
- Added rate limiting infrastructure
- Added recipient caching infrastructure

#### Compatibility
- Fixed OpenClaw camelCase field mapping (`sourceNumber`, `sourceUuid`, `sourceDevice`, `dataMessage`, `groupInfo`, `contentType`, `groupId`, `groupName`)

#### Code Quality
- Zero clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- Added comprehensive unit tests (13 tests passing)

- **Fixed CORS vulnerability** - Changed from insecure `allow_origin(Any)` to environment-based CORS with configurable `CORS_ORIGINS` env var
- Restricted HTTP methods to GET, POST, PUT, DELETE only
- Restricted headers to Content-Type only

### Code Quality
- Zero dead code warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D dead_code`)
- Zero clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- Fixed unused imports and variables

### Configuration
- Centralized magic numbers in `config.rs`
- Added `SEARCH_BATCH_SIZE` configuration
- Environment variable documentation in README

### Performance

- Added rust-toolchain.toml for version consistency
- Added .yamllint configuration
- Added .yamllint configuration
- Fixed systemd service validation (removed unavailable systemd-analyze)

### Build Profile
- Changed to `opt-level = "z"` for smaller binaries
- Added `lto = "fat"` and `codegen-units = 1` for optimization
- Added profile for all dependencies

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with v0.8.1
- Created AGENTS.md with agent execution log
- Added CORS_ORIGINS to environment variables table
